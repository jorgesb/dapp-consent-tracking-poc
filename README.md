# Dapp application for consent tracking &amp; management
This project is a Proof of Concept of a Dapp to store transactions data on the Ethereum network when a consumer subscribes or unsubscribe to a specific channel (opt) as well as the legal text that has been approved on the related subscription.

Afterwards we will be able to check and validate information about consumers opt-in/opt-outs against this system.

## List of technologies used
    - Node.js: the project implemented to handle the blockchain use several node modules.
    - Express: blockchain API and routes (endpoints)
    - Web3.js: Ethereum Javascript API, used to communicate with the smart contract methods
    - Solidity: contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts
    - Mocha: for testing the smart contract
    - Truffle: development environment and testing framework for Ethereum
    - Ganache: development Ethereum network
    - Remix: Online open source tool for testing and debugging smart contracts. http://remix.ethereum.org/
